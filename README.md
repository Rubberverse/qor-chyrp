## ü¶Ü Rubberverse Dockerfiles

Experimental rootless containers running specific per-service configurations, utilizing Nginx and PHP-FPM. Intended for specific php-focused projects.

Every image makes use of `tini` and runs both Nginx that and php-fpm as rootless user, while encompassing special configuration files to make them plug-n-play when moving from bare-metal deployment.

It's as simple as building the image from the Dockerfile and then running it.

## üê≥ General Dockerfile Configuration

- If Debian base image, debloats the image by removing a lot of system utilities and left-overs from apt, this means that systemd is also in turn purged away from the base image
- Runs by default as unprivileged user called `nginx_user` with both UID and GID of `1001`
- Both Nginx and php-fpm processes run as unprivileged user
- Nginx communicates with php-fpm via it's unix socket, which can be found in `/app/run/php-fpm.sock`, PID files can be found in same directory
- Log files are accessible in following directories: `/app/configs/fpm` and `/app/configs/nginx`
- These images are made in mind that you will only host a certain service it's made for and nothing else
- Clean URLs support via a custom nginx configuration for services that support it

## üíÅ Project Assumptions

- This will be only used to reverse traffic to another web server such as Caddy that will terminate TLS, and in turn expose the service out to the world
- You won't modify core Nginx configuration as it's already set in a good-enough, production-ready manner. Although you're free to modify entrypoint script to change that and customize the Dockerfile to your liking, it's self-documented with CLI commands so shouldn't be too hard. (Create GitHub issue if you need help!)
