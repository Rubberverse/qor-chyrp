- üì¶ With following packages: `curl`, `envsubst`, `ca-certificates`, `tini`, `nginx`, `php8.2` and `supercronic`

üíÅ Supercronic was used because normal cron requires root permissions in order to run

## üõ†Ô∏è Build guide

1. Git clone this repository
2. Navigate to freshrss
3. Copy following files from configs: `fpm.conf`, `www.conf`, `nginx.conf` to freshrss
4. Copy `remove-junk.sh` from scritps to freshrss
5. Run `podman build -f nginx-fpm.Dockerfile -t localhost/freshrss:latest`
6. Look into the Dockerfile to see environmental variables, you definitely want to customize the `NGINX_` ones to your liking
7. Deploy it and navigate to `http://localhost:9001`

## ü§† Usage

You probably want to mount `/app/www/freshrss/data` for data persistence. If you will do a bind mount, make sure to mirror the exact contents of the directory (can be done by downloading FreshRSS off their GitHub page and copying `data` folder)

If you want, you should mount `/app/www/freshrss/extensions` too, so you can install custom extensions easily.

You will need a valid MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL installation, though you also have sqlite3 option which is probably what you want if you will be the only one using it.
